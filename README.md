# CovidCounter

This project aims to put the most recent available Covid numbers (typically previous day) into perspective by showing the average time for each new case/death, as well as displaying a counter for new cases/deaths since visiting the site.

 - Initially, only for US as a whole, but will break down to regions, as well as expand to different nations in time. 
 - Will also include safety tips for staying safe.
